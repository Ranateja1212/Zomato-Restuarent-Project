# Zomato-Restuarent-Project

The Zomato EDA process, like any EDA process, involves exploring and understanding the data before diving into any further analysis or modeling. Here's a breakdown of the typical steps:

1. Data Acquisition and Understanding:

Source the data: You can find publicly available Zomato datasets on platforms like Kaggle or scrape it yourself using their API.
Explore the data structure: Understand the different features, their data types, and any missing values.
Identify potential problems: Check for duplicates, inconsistencies, and outliers.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values: Decide how to impute or remove missing data appropriately.
Transform features: Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features if necessary.
Create new features: Combine existing features to create meaningful insights.
3. Exploratory Analysis and Visualization:

Analyze basic statistics: Calculate central tendency, dispersion, and distribution of data for each feature.
Create visualizations: Use bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots to visualize data relationships and trends.
Analyze specific aspects: Explore relationships between features like restaurant type, rating, cuisine, location, and price.
Identify patterns and anomalies: Look for interesting trends, outliers, and potential areas for further investigation.
4. Documentation and Conclusions:

Document your findings: Summarize the key insights you discovered during the EDA process.
Formulate questions and hypotheses: Based on your findings, define questions you want to answer with further analysis or modeling.
Additional Tools and Techniques:

Descriptive statistics: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, quartiles, etc.
Correlation analysis: Measure the strength and direction of relationships between features.
Clustering: Group restaurants based on similar characteristics.
Dimensionality reduction: Reduce the number of features for easier analysis.
